# AI-Healthcare-Solutions-with-Mistral

This MLOps project showcases the integration and optimization of the Mistral Large Language Model (LLM) deployed on Google Cloud's Vertex AI, aimed at improving AI-driven healthcare responses. The project involves tuning and fine-tuning processes using the MASQA dataset to better address specific healthcare queries like optimal exercises for asthma patients. Various techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, along with RAG architecture, were implemented to refine the model's response accuracy and adaptability. Additionally, the use of Vertex AI provided essential infrastructure benefits including scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness, which are crucial for handling sensitive healthcare data. The model was continuously improved through real-time performance monitoring and A/B testing, ensuring it remained effective and efficient in a dynamic healthcare environment. This initiative not only demonstrates the technical capabilities of handling large parameter models like Mistral but also emphasizes the practical impact of AI in enhancing patient care through accurate and reliable medical advice.
